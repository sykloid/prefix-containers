=================

A Trie (also called a digital tree, or prefix tree) is a data structure for
storing sequences, which supports an efficient query to determine which keys
contain a common prefix. The Trie can either simply store whether or not a
sequence is contained within (TrieSet), or it can associate a value with each
sequence (TrieMap).
